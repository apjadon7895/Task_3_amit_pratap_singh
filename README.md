# Weather React App

## Overview

This is a weather application built with React that fetches and displays current weather data and forecasts using the OpenWeatherMap API. The application is responsive and includes features such as real-time weather updates, hourly and daily forecasts, and dynamic background changes based on temperature.

## Features

- **Current Weather:** Displays current temperature, weather conditions, humidity, wind speed, and sunrise/sunset times.
- **Hourly Forecast:** Shows a 3-hour step forecast for the upcoming hours.
- **Daily Forecast:** Provides a daily forecast for the next several days.
- **Responsive Design:** Adapts to different screen sizes, including mobile and desktop views.
- **Dynamic Background:** Changes background colors based on temperature.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **Luxon:** Library for handling and formatting dates and times.
- **OpenWeatherMap API:** Provides weather data for the application.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
- A VS Code editor for code editing.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-react-app.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd weather-react-app
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set Up Environment Variables:**

   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
   - Add your OpenWeatherMap API key to the `.env` file:

     ```
     REACT_APP_API_KEY=your_openweathermap_api_key
     ```

5. **Start the Development Server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the React development server and open the application in your default browser.

## Code Structure

- **`src/`**: Contains the source code for the React application.
  - **`Components/`**: Contains React components such as `TopButtons`, `Search`, `TimeAndLocation`, `TempAndDetails`, and `Forecast`.
  - **`Services/`**: Contains utility functions for fetching and formatting weather data (`WeatherServices.js`).
  - **`App.js`**: Main application component that combines all other components.
- **`public/`**: Contains static files like `index.html` and favicon.
- **`package.json`**: Lists project dependencies and scripts.

## Usage

- **Search for Weather:** Use the search bar to enter a location and get the current weather and forecast.
- **Change Units:** Switch between metric and imperial units to see temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit.
- **View Forecast:** Check hourly and daily forecasts for detailed weather information.

## Customization

- **Styling:** Modify Tailwind CSS classes in `src/App.js` and component files to adjust the design.
- **API Key:** Replace the placeholder API key in the `.env` file with your own OpenWeatherMap API key.
